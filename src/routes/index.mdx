<Title>Are.na demo</Title>

This site demos experimental image gallery interactions I developed in the summer of 2024. It's primarily an are.na block renderer, used by inserting this code block into documents:

``` jsx
<ArenaBlock blockId={39352077} />
```


First developed for my [homepage](https://jake.kitchen), then for Atlas (link TBD), both projects were taken in different directions.


Check out the example sub-pages:
