<Title>Trestle</Title>

This site demos experimental image gallery interactions from the summer of 2024. It's primarily an [are.na](https://are.na) block renderer, used by inserting this code block into documents:

``` jsx
<ArenaBlock blockId={39352077} />
```


First developed for my [homepage](https://jake.kitchen), then for Atlas (link TBD). Both projects were taken in different directions.

Now this is a template - clone it at [jakeisnt/trestle](https://github.com/jakeisnt/trestle) to get started.

Check out the example sub-pages:
- [S:t Gorans kyrka](/st-gorans-kyrka)
- [Franzengatan 1b](/franzengatan-1b)

or click on the image to start exploring.


Enjoy!

Best, [Jake Chvatal](https://jake.kitchen). ([Uln.Industries](https://uln.industries))
