Located on Stockholm's western island, Kungsholmen, 
S:t Görans kyrka is one of the most popular churches in Sweden.

<ArenaBlock blockId={29846620} />

Though construction finished in 1958, it's one of the best examples of early "Svensk modernism" in the city: 
the interior is covered with a large, art-deco-style mural, and small, sculptural motifs adorn key parts of the building 
-- like the altar, the pulpit, and the organ -- while the majority of the church is completely unadorned.

<div style={{"display": "flex", 'justify-content': 'space-between', gap: '10px' }}>
<ArenaBlock blockId={29846071} />
<ArenaBlock blockId={29846110} />
<ArenaBlock blockId={29846072} />
</div>

Super awesome test text listed after the church.
